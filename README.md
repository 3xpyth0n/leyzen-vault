Leyzen Vault automates ephemeral container rotation across pluggable workloads. A hardened Flask orchestrator coordinates Docker lifecycle operations through an allowlisted proxy, while HAProxy front-ends every request with strict security headers. The system demonstrates how moving-target defense principles can be applied to real-world stacks without sacrificing observability or operator experience.

## Feature Highlights

- **Dynamic stack composition** – `leyzenctl` regenerates Docker Compose and HAProxy artifacts on every lifecycle command so configuration always reflects the active plugin.
- **Rotation-aware control plane** – The orchestrator promotes one healthy replica at a time, keeps rotation state auditable, and exposes SSE telemetry for dashboards and automations.
- **Defense-in-depth defaults** – Captcha-backed authentication, CSP reporting, proxy trust limits, and bearer-token Docker access are enabled from the first boot.
- **Extensible plugin model** – Service definitions live in Python packages under `vault_plugins/`, allowing new workloads to slot into the rotation loop with minimal boilerplate.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, copy `env.template` to `.env`, and build the CLI with `./install.sh`. Full installation, configuration, and first-run steps are documented in the [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault/wiki/Quickstart).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault.git
cd leyzen-vault
cp env.template .env
./install.sh
./leyzenctl start
```

**Note**: The `docker-compose.yml` file in the repository root is automatically generated by `compose/build.py`. Do not edit it manually; it will be regenerated by `leyzenctl` commands or when running the build script directly.

## Architecture at a Glance

Leyzen Vault comprises a Go CLI, Python builders, HAProxy front end, Docker proxy, and Flask orchestrator with rotation telemetry. Review the [Architecture](https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault/wiki/Architecture) page for diagrams, rotation flow, and component responsibilities.
