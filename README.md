## Overview 🧩

Leyzen Vault is a **proof-of-concept for moving-target defense**, applying infrastructure polymorphism to containerized applications. The orchestrator continuously rotates _Filebrowser_ backends while maintaining a seamless user experience. Each container’s lifecycle is ephemeral — born, used, and destroyed — minimizing the attack persistence window.

---

## Key Features 🔑

- **Autonomous container rotation** keeps workloads shifting to shrink the attacker dwell time window.
- **Self-healing deployment** restarts components automatically when health checks fail.
- **Centralized observability** exposes live orchestrator metrics and audit logs.
- **Security-first defaults** rely on minimal network exposure and enforced credential rotation.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vault Orchestrator**  | Python-based orchestrator handling container rotation, metrics, and dashboard rendering.                                                    |
| **Filebrowser Cluster** | Trio of lightweight file-manager containers rotated polymorphically.                                                                        |
| **HAProxy**             | Reverse proxy exposed on port **8080**, routing users to Filebrowser or the Orchestrator dashboard.                                         |
| **Shared Volumes**      | Docker volumes (`filebrowser-data`, `filebrowser-database`, `filebrowser-config`) persisting uploads, users, and settings across rotations. |

## Prerequisites 🧰

- Docker Engine + Compose plugin
- Git
- `sudo` privileges for installation
- Ability to create system users and assign them to the `docker` group (the installer provisions a dedicated `leyzen` account).

---

## Installation 🧭

Clone the repository and bootstrap the Docker services:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault.git
cd leyzen-vault
cp env.template .env
```

Review `.env` before the first launch and set strong secrets. Then start the full stack using the helper script:

```bash
./service.sh start
```

> 💡 **If you’re testing the stack over plain HTTP (`http://localhost:8080`)**: set `VAULT_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` in your `.env` file (see the documented block in [`.env`/`env.template`](env.template)). Without this setting, the session cookie’s `Secure` attribute prevents it from being sent without TLS, causing a login loop.

If the stack is managed through `systemd`, run the installer to provision the service unit:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
sudo systemctl enable --now leyzen.service
```

The installer provisions a dedicated `leyzen` system user and adds it to the `docker` group so the service can interact with the Docker Engine without running as `root`. Ensure the `docker` group exists (it is created automatically by Docker packages) and that your administrator account can manage group membership.

> ⚠️ **Security reminder:** Set `FILEBROWSER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a long, random value and rotate it regularly.

---

## Configuration 🧪

### Environment variables

Environment variables are loaded from `.env`. Restrict the file’s permissions (for example, `chmod 600 .env`) and keep it out of shared locations to prevent credential leakage. Key entries include:

- `VAULT_USER` / `VAULT_PASS` — dashboard credentials; never commit real values.
- `VAULT_SECRET_KEY` — Flask secret key (use `openssl rand -hex 32`).
- `FILEBROWSER_ADMIN_USER` / `FILEBROWSER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — Filebrowser administrator credentials.
- `VAULT_ROTATION_INTERVAL` — rotation interval (seconds) for backend containers.
- `VAULT_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` — mark orchestrator session cookies as `Secure` when HTTPS terminates upstream (enabled by default).
- `VAULT_WEB_CONTAINERS` — comma-separated list of containers eligible for rotation.
- `DOCKER_PROXY_URL` and `DOCKER_PROXY_TOKEN` — access details for the secured Docker proxy.
- `PROXY_TRUST_COUNT` — number of upstream proxies whose forwarded headers should be trusted (`0` when serving requests directly, `1` when HAProxy fronts the stack); see [`env.template`](env.template) for additional guidance.

Consult [`env.template`](env.template) for the full list and documentation of supported variables. When provisioning the optional systemd unit via `install.sh`, the installer automatically enforces the restrictive `.env` permissions so service deployments stay aligned with these recommendations.

### Docker resources

The stack relies on Docker volumes declared in `docker-compose.yml` for Filebrowser data persistence. Ensure the Docker daemon user can access:

- `filebrowser-data`
- `filebrowser-database`
- `filebrowser-config`

---

## Usage 🛠️

The `service.sh` helper centralizes day-to-day operations:

```bash
./service.sh start    # Launch all containers in detached mode
./service.sh stop     # Stop and remove running containers (volumes are preserved)
./service.sh build    # Rebuild images and restart the stack
./service.sh restart  # Stop then start the stack again
./service.sh status   # Display container states and exposed ports
```

To manage the optional systemd unit:

```bash
sudo systemctl status leyzen.service      # Inspect service health
journalctl -u leyzen.service -f           # Follow live logs
```

---

## Security 🔐

Leyzen Vault ships with layered safeguards intended to shrink the attack surface while keeping the demo stack operable:

- **Browser protections** — The orchestrator templates enforce a locked-down Content Security Policy (CSP) and embed CSRF tokens so that authenticated actions cannot be replayed from foreign origins.
- **Abuse defenses** — Login flows require CAPTCHA completion and throttle repeated attempts, limiting credential stuffing windows.
- **Network isolation** — Administrative Docker operations are gated behind the separate [`docker-proxy`](docker-proxy) service, ensuring the Docker socket is never exposed directly to end users.
- **Secrets hygiene** — All credentials and API tokens reside in a local `.env` file with restrictive permissions (`chmod 600 .env` recommended) and must be provisioned before first launch.

Operationally critical settings include:

- `VAULT_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` — Keep this enabled in production so session cookies are transmitted only over HTTPS; disable temporarily **only** for local HTTP testing.
- `DOCKER_PROXY_TOKEN` — Rotate the proxy bearer token regularly and update any automation that references it.
- `.env` permissions — Ensure only the service account (and trusted administrators) can read secrets by locking down the file system access bits.

## Project Status 📊

Leyzen Vault is an evolving demonstrator exploring automated ephemeral backends, dynamic routing, and autonomous cyber defense patterns.

Automated GitHub Actions CI runs [`python -m compileall orchestrator docker-proxy`](https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault/actions/workflows/ci.yml) on every push and pull request to catch syntax issues early in both Python services.
