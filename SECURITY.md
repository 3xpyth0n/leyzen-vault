# Leyzen Vault Security Policy

## Supported Releases

Leyzen Vault is a proof-of-concept project. We currently maintain only the `main` branch and the latest tagged release. Older tags or forks do not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues through one of the private channels below:

- GitHub Security Advisories: [Create a private report](https://github.com/3xpyth0n/leyzen-vault/security/advisories/new).

Avoid filing public GitHub issues for vulnerabilities until we have coordinated on a fix or disclosure timeline.

## Response Expectations

- **Acknowledgement:** Within 2 business days.
- **Initial assessment:** Within 5 business days. We will clarify scope, gather reproduction details, and discuss impact.
- **Fix or mitigation:** Targeted within 30 days for high-impact issues and 90 days for lower-severity findings.

We will keep reporters informed of progress and coordinate disclosure once a fix or mitigation is available.
