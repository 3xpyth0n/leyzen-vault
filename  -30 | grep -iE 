ui: require CTRL+C confirmation to quit and remove unused VAULT_DOCKER_NETWORK
- Replace 'q' key quit binding with CTRL+C requiring double-press confirmation
- Add quit confirmation dialog visible across all views (dashboard, logs, config, wizard, action)
- Implement quitConfirm state management with automatic cancellation on any non-CTRL+C keypress
- Remove VAULT_DOCKER_NETWORK from wizard prompts and validators (unused configuration variable)
- Update all footer hints and help messages to display CTRL+C instead of 'q' for quitting
- Reset quit confirmation state on view transitions to prevent lingering prompts

This change prevents accidental application exit when typing 'q' in the wizard
input fields and provides a safety mechanism requiring explicit confirmation
before quitting.

fix: resolve naming inconsistencies and standardize environment loading
- Standardize VAULT_* variables in Go CLI (PLUGIN→SERVICE, REPLICAS→WEB_REPLICAS, etc.)
- Align VAULT_ROTATION_INTERVAL to 120s
- Fix wizard time unit (minutes→seconds)
- Standardize LOG_LEVEL → DOCKER_PROXY_LOG_LEVEL
- Rename orchestrator/SECURITY.md → SECURITY_RUNTIME.md
- Add load_env_with_override() and refactor environment loading
- Improve Python guidelines compliance (imports, annotations)
- Clean up debug logs and improve documentation

Fixes 15 issues identified during technical audit.

Update Release Workflow

chore: Translate all remaining French comments and text to English
Searched the entire repository and translated all occurrences to English across CLI and Compose modules.
Updated UI files (view.go, update.go, model.go, runner.go) and validation logic, replacing wizard button text and inline comments.
Verified that no French terms remain in the codebase.

Update CHANGELOG.md

chore(release): prepare v1.1.0 changelog and cleanup

feat(tui): implement view navigation, interactive wizard, and config management
- Add ViewState-based navigation with clean transitions and auto-return to dashboard.
- Integrate interactive wizard with dynamic field loading and template initialization.
- Add Config view with categorized variables, scrolling, and password toggle.

feat: Add Bubbletea-based leyzenctl TUI dashboard with live controls
- Added a Bubbletea and Lipgloss-powered leyzenctl dashboard featuring status polling, live log view, and keyboard-driven lifecycle actions for restart, start, stop, and rebuild.
- Made the TUI the default root command with a --no-ui flag for headless mode.
- Updated compose helpers to stream output to the interface and documented the new interactive workflow in the changelog.

feat(env): propagate "--env-file" override into compose manifest generation
The build system now updates all env_file entries with the selected environment file.
Ensures Docker Compose reflects the correct variables during builds.
Adds clear logging when a custom environment file is applied.

fix: Improve Filebrowser entrypoint privilege handling and startup resilience
- Relaxed privilege dropping to allow container startup when mounted volumes are unwritable, easing recovery on restrictive hosts.
- Fixed a regression causing `tmp: parameter not set` errors during write-access checks.
- Handled pre-existing databases gracefully so restarts no longer loop when only the settings file is missing.

docs: migrate documentation to dedicated GitHub Wiki
- Removed local technical and maintainer guides now centralized in the official wiki.
- Updated README and SECURITY references to point toward the new documentation.
- Cleaned obsolete developer and operations files from /docs and root.
- Added changelog and contributor notes reflecting the wiki migration.

Added read-only permission to the CI workflow

feat: Replace service.sh with Cobra-based leyzenctl CLI and update docs
- Introduced a full-featured leyzenctl CLI built with Cobra, including start, stop, restart, build, status, and configuration subcommands.
- Added supporting modules for Docker control, environment handling, and validation.
- Removed service.sh and updated all guides, templates, and policies to reference the new CLI.
- Created LEYZENCTL.md and refreshed README, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG accordingly.

fix: Dynamically import orchestrator configuration for CI and container compatibility
- Modified the entrypoint to dynamically import the orchestrator configuration module after resolving the package path, ensuring it runs correctly in both CI and container environments.
- Preserved defensive error handling and static-analysis hints for ConfigurationError.

Update CI Python workflow #2
